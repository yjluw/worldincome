# Introduction
In an era of rapid globalization and technological advancement, world income inequality is becoming a more and more serious problem. The growing disparity between the wealthy and the poor, more than simply shaping economic outcomes, has profoundly influenced social mobility, educational opportunities, and political stability across nations. Using the comprehensive World Income Inequality Database (WIID) maintained by UNU-WIDER, which contains over 24,000 data points across 201 countries until the year 2022, our analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in global income distribution. We are particularly interested in examining how income inequality has evolved over time and understanding the relationship between a country's economic development and its income distribution. The fact that income inequality has been influential in poverty reduction, social cohesion, and sustainable development goals makes our investigation meaningful. By analyzing the data, we hope to provide insights into the drivers of income inequality and solutions to promote more equitable and inclusive societies.
