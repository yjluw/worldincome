    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn an era of rapid globalization and technological advancement, world income inequality is becoming a more and more serious problem. The growing disparity between the wealthy and the poor, more than simply shaping economic outcomes, has profoundly influenced social mobility, educational opportunities, and political stability across nations. For this project, we will be using the World Income Inequality Database maintained by the United Nations University World Institute, which contains over 24000 data points across 201 countries in over 40 years including measures like population, GDP and income. Our analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in global income distribution. We are particularly interested in examining how income inequality has evolved over time and understanding the relationship between a country’s economic development and its income distribution. The fact that income inequality has been influential in poverty reduction, social cohesion, and sustainable development goals makes our investigation meaningful. By analyzing the data, we hope to provide insights into the drivers of income inequality and solutions to promote more equitable and inclusive societies.",

We can also see that countries in Europe and America have the most frequent data recordings, with almost a data point for each year. Whereas for African countries, data are measured less frequently.\n\n\nCode\nData &lt;- read_xlsx(\"WIID_28NOV2023.xlsx\")\ncolnum &lt;- ncol(Data)\nData |&gt; mutate(total_missing = rowSums(is.na(Data))) |&gt; group_by(country)|&gt; mutate(rownum = n()) |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; group_by(region_un,country) |&gt; summarize(missing=sum(total_missing)/(unique(rownum)*colnum)) |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; mutate(region_un=if_else(country==\"Turkiye\",\"Europe\",region_un))|&gt; ggplot(aes(y=fct_reorder(country,missing),x=missing,fill=region_un))+geom_col()+theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5)) +labs(x=\"Percentage of Missing \",y=\"Country\",title = \"Percentage of Missing per contry in different regions\") + facet_wrap(~region_un,ncol=1,scales = \"free_y\")\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'region_un'.

In Africa,a wide range of missing percentages with some countries having very high percentages (close to 50% or more), which suggests potential challenges in data collection or reporting consistency in this region.\nIn Asia, countries generally have moderate to low missing data percentages, while a few countries have higher percentages.\nIn Americas and Europe, lower percentage of countries contains high percentage of missing values while smaller countries and island nations have slightly higher missing percentages, which is consistent with the insight from the last graph where Americas and Europe has fewer challenges in data collection and report the data more frequently. In Oceania, smaller amount of countries belong to this region and most of them have relatively lower missing percentages, which means data availability are better in this developed countries.",
