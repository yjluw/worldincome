    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn an era of rapid globalization and technological advancement, world income inequality is becoming a more and more serious problem. The growing disparity between the wealthy and the poor, more than simply shaping economic outcomes, has profoundly influenced social mobility, educational opportunities, and political stability across nations. For this project, we will be using the World Income Inequality Database maintained by the United Nations University World Institute, which contains over 24000 data points across 201 countries in over 40 years including measures like population, GDP and income. Our analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in global income distribution. We are particularly interested in examining how income inequality has evolved over time and understanding the relationship between a country’s economic development and its income distribution. The fact that income inequality has been influential in poverty reduction, social cohesion, and sustainable development goals makes our investigation meaningful. By analyzing the data, we hope to provide insights into the drivers of income inequality and solutions to promote more equitable and inclusive societies.",

Each boxplot represents a World Bank income classification, with points indicating the mean Gini coefficient for individual countries over the period.

By focusing on long-term averages rather than year-by-year data, the plot unveils enduring patterns in how typical inequality levels differ across varying stages of economic development.\nNote: Higher Gini coefficients indicate greater income inequality (scale: 0–100).

For each decade since 2000, we track the three countries with highest and lowest inequality from each region, taking into account population size. The dual-panel view allows us to contrast patterns between high and low inequality countries, revealing how economic development relates to income distribution across different contexts.\nNote: GDP per capita is shown on a logarithmic scale to better display relationships across different income levels. Point size indicates population.\n\n\nCode\n# First, get preferred gini values by prioritizing\ndata_clean &lt;- data |&gt; \n  group_by(country, year) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(!is.na(gini)),\n         desc(popcovr == \"All\"),\n         resource == \"Earnings\") |&gt;\n  slice(1) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n# Function to get top/bottom 3 countries for each region in a given decade\nget_extreme_countries &lt;- function(data, decade_start, is_top = TRUE) {\n  ordering_fn &lt;- if(is_top) slice_max else slice_min\n  \n  data |&gt;\n    filter(year &gt;= decade_start, \n           year &lt; decade_start + 10,\n           !is.na(gini), \n           !is.na(gdp), \n           !is.na(population),\n           !is.na(region_un)) |&gt;\n    group_by(region_un, country) |&gt;\n    summarize(\n      gini = mean(gini),\n      gdp = mean(gdp),\n      population = mean(population),\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    group_by(region_un) |&gt;\n    ordering_fn(order_by = gini, n = 3, with_ties = FALSE) |&gt;\n    mutate(decade = paste0(decade_start, \"s\"))\n}\n\n# Get data for each decade\ntop_data_2000 &lt;- get_extreme_countries(data_clean, 2000, TRUE)\ntop_data_2010 &lt;- get_extreme_countries(data_clean, 2010, TRUE)\ntop_data_2020 &lt;- get_extreme_countries(data_clean, 2020, TRUE)\nbottom_data_2000 &lt;- get_extreme_countries(data_clean, 2000, FALSE)\nbottom_data_2010 &lt;- get_extreme_countries(data_clean, 2010, FALSE)\nbottom_data_2020 &lt;- get_extreme_countries(data_clean, 2020, FALSE)\n\n# Combine all data\nplot_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  top_data_2000, top_data_2010, top_data_2020,\n  bottom_data_2000, bottom_data_2010, bottom_data_2020\n) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    log_gdp = log10(gdp),\n    pop_scaled = sqrt(population)/10000,\n    type = ifelse(gini &gt; median(gini), \"High Inequality\", \"Low Inequality\")\n  )\n\ngdp_range &lt;- range(plot_data$log_gdp, na.rm = TRUE)\nx_limits &lt;- c(floor(gdp_range[1]), ceiling(gdp_range[2]))\n\n# Modify both plots to use the same x-axis limits\nhigh_ineq_plot &lt;- ggplot(\n  filter(plot_data, type == \"High Inequality\"), \n  aes(x = log_gdp, y = gini)\n) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = pop_scaled, color = region_un), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = country), size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~decade) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = x_limits,  # Add this line\n    breaks = log10(c(1000, 10000, 100000)),\n    labels = c(\"1,000\", \"10,000\", \"100,000\")\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(\n    name = \"Population (millions)\",\n    breaks = sqrt(c(100, 500, 1000))/10000,\n    labels = c(\"100M\", \"500M\", \"1B\")\n  ) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Highest Inequality Countries by Region\",\n    x = \"GDP per capita (USD, log scale)\",\n    y = \"Gini Coefficient\",\n    color = \"Region\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(1, \"cm\"))\n\nlow_ineq_plot &lt;- ggplot(\n  filter(plot_data, type == \"Low Inequality\"), \n  aes(x = log_gdp, y = gini)\n) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = pop_scaled, color = region_un), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = country), size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~decade) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = x_limits,  # Add this line\n    breaks = log10(c(1000, 10000, 100000)),\n    labels = c(\"1,000\", \"10,000\", \"100,000\")\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(\n    name = \"Population (millions)\",\n    breaks = sqrt(c(100, 500, 1000))/10000,\n    labels = c(\"100M\", \"500M\", \"1B\")\n  ) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Lowest Inequality Countries by Region\",\n    x = \"GDP per capita (USD, log scale)\",\n    y = \"Gini Coefficient\",\n    color = \"Region\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(1, \"cm\"))\n\n# Combine plots vertically\nscatter_gini_gdp &lt;- high_ineq_plot / low_ineq_plot +\n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\") &\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\nscatter_gini_gdp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization highlights two key stories in global inequality over the past two decades. The top panels feature the most unequal nations, where countries like South Africa consistently rank at the top, joined by a mix of both wealthier and lower-income economies. The bottom panels show the least unequal societies, many of which are European, but also include lower-income countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Ethiopia—suggesting that prosperity alone does not guarantee greater equality.\nOverall, these patterns challenge the assumption that higher income levels automatically lead to less inequality. Instead, the distribution of income appears more influenced by domestic policies, institutions, and social choices than by economic status alone.",

The bottom blue line in each graph represents the GDP growth rate for the corresponding year. From Brazil’s graph, we observe that the top 20% income group accounted for over 60% of the country’s total GDP prior to 1994. Additionally, both GDP distribution and growth rates showed significant annual fluctuations. After the introduction of the new currency, the Brazilian Real, the income share of the bottom 20% gradually increased, GDP growth rate fluctuations reduced, and income inequality in the country began to alleviate.\n\n\nCode\ndata_US &lt;- data |&gt; filter(country == 'Brazil')\ndata_US_unique &lt;- data_US %&gt;%\n  group_by(country, year) %&gt;%         \n  arrange(desc(!is.na(q1)),            # Prioritize rows with non-null q1\n          desc(popcovr == \"All\"),      # Then prioritize popcovr == \"All\"\n          resource == \"Earnings\") %&gt;% # Then prioritize resource == \"Earnings\"\n  slice(1) %&gt;%                         # Select the first row after sorting\n  ungroup()  \n\n\n# Define the range of years to display (1970–2022)\nall_years &lt;- seq(1970, 2022)\n\n# Prepare data for the bar plot (q1-q5)\ndata_US_long &lt;- data_US_unique %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 1970 & year &lt;= 2022) %&gt;%  # Filter for the year range\n  select(year, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, gdp_increase_rate) %&gt;%  # Include GDP increase rate\n  pivot_longer(cols = q1:q5, names_to = \"Income_Class\", values_to = \"Percentage\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = replace_na(Percentage, 0)) %&gt;% # Replace NA with 0\n  complete(year = all_years, Income_Class = unique(.$Income_Class), fill = list(Percentage = 0))\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart with GDP increase rate line overlay\nggplot(data_US_long, aes(x = factor(year))) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = Percentage, fill = Income_Class), stat = \"identity\") + # Stacked bar chart\n  geom_line(data = data_US_unique %&gt;% filter(year &gt;= 1970 & year &lt;= 2022), \n            aes(y = gdp_increase_rate, group = 1), \n            color = \"blue\", size = 1.2) + # Line plot for GDP increase rate\n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(factor(2020, levels = all_years)), \n             color = \"red\", size = 0.8) +\n  geom_label(aes(x = as.numeric(factor(2020, levels = all_years)), \n                 y = 105),  # Place the label slightly above the maximum bar height\n             label = \"COVID-19\", \n             fill = \"yellow\",  # Highlight color\n             color = \"black\",  # Text color\n             fontface = \"bold\", size = 3) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(factor(1994, levels = all_years)), \n             color = \"red\", size = 0.8) +\n  geom_label(aes(x = as.numeric(factor(1994, levels = all_years)), \n                 y = 105),  # Place the label slightly above the maximum bar height\n             label = \"BRL Introduced\", \n             fill = \"yellow\",  # Highlight color\n             color = \"black\",  # Text color\n             fontface = \"bold\", size = 3) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(factor(1980, levels = all_years)), \n             color = \"red\", size = 0.8) +\n  geom_label(aes(x = as.numeric(factor(1980, levels = all_years)), \n                 y = 105),  # Place the label slightly above the maximum bar height\n             label = \"Debt Crisis\", \n             fill = \"yellow\",  # Highlight color\n             color = \"black\",  # Text color\n             fontface = \"bold\", size = 3) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 0.5) + # Line for y = 0\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\", name = \"Income Quintile\") + # Use discrete color palette\n  labs(title = \"Brazil Income Distribution by Quintile (Q1-Q5) with GDP Increase Rate\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., name = \"GDP Increase Rate (relative scale)\"))",

Over the past fifty years, there have been no substantial fluctuations in the income share of each quantile group, except for a steady increase in the share of the highest income group (represented by the blue q5 bar), which aligns with the gradually rising Gini coefficient in the United States. Even during major financial events such as the 2008 financial crisis, the income distribution in the U.S. remained largely unchanged. This stability may be attributed to the relatively consistent economic growth trajectory in the U.S. (represented by the dark blue GDP growth curve), where even significant economic events have not caused large fluctuations to the GDP growth rate.\n\n\nCode\ndata_US &lt;- data |&gt; filter(country == 'United States')\ndata_US_unique &lt;- data_US %&gt;%\n  group_by(country, year) %&gt;%         \n  arrange(desc(!is.na(q1)),            # Prioritize rows with non-null q1\n          desc(popcovr == \"All\"),      # Then prioritize popcovr == \"All\"\n          resource == \"Earnings\") %&gt;% # Then prioritize resource == \"Earnings\"\n  slice(1) %&gt;%                         # Select the first row after sorting\n  ungroup()  \n\n\n# Define the range of years to display (1970–2022)\nall_years &lt;- seq(1970, 2022)\n\n# Prepare data for the bar plot (q1-q5)\ndata_US_long &lt;- data_US_unique %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 1970 & year &lt;= 2022) %&gt;%  # Filter for the year range\n  select(year, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, gdp_increase_rate) %&gt;%  # Include GDP increase rate\n  pivot_longer(cols = q1:q5, names_to = \"Income_Class\", values_to = \"Percentage\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = replace_na(Percentage, 0)) %&gt;% # Replace NA with 0\n  complete(year = all_years, Income_Class = unique(.$Income_Class), fill = list(Percentage = 0))\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart with GDP increase rate line overlay\nggplot(data_US_long, aes(x = factor(year))) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = Percentage, fill = Income_Class), stat = \"identity\") + # Stacked bar chart\n  geom_line(data = data_US_unique %&gt;% filter(year &gt;= 1970 & year &lt;= 2022), \n            aes(y = gdp_increase_rate, group = 1), \n            color = \"blue\", size = 1.2) + # Line plot for GDP increase rate\n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(factor(2020, levels = all_years)), \n             color = \"red\", size = 0.8) +\n  geom_label(aes(x = as.numeric(factor(2020, levels = all_years)), \n                 y = 105),  # Place the label slightly above the maximum bar height\n             label = \"COVID-19\", \n             fill = \"yellow\",  # Highlight color\n             color = \"black\",  # Text color\n             fontface = \"bold\", size = 3) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(factor(2008, levels = all_years)), \n             color = \"red\", size = 0.8) +\n  geom_label(aes(x = as.numeric(factor(2008, levels = all_years)), \n                 y = 105),  # Place the label slightly above the maximum bar height\n             label = \"Financial Crisis\", \n             fill = \"yellow\",  # Highlight color\n             color = \"black\",  # Text color\n             fontface = \"bold\", size = 3) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(factor(1991, levels = all_years)), \n             color = \"red\", size = 0.8) +\n  geom_label(aes(x = as.numeric(factor(1991, levels = all_years)), \n                 y = 105),  # Place the label slightly above the maximum bar height\n             label = \"End of Cold War\", \n             fill = \"yellow\",  # Highlight color\n             color = \"black\",  # Text color\n             fontface = \"bold\", size = 3) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 0.5) + # Line for y = 0\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\", name = \"Income Quintile\") + # Use discrete color palette\n  labs(title = \"Income Distribution by Quintile (Q1-Q5) with GDP Increase Rate\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., name = \"GDP Increase Rate (relative scale)\"))",

So we can see the mobility of the countries in gini categories.\nFrom the Plot, we can see most countries stay in one categories for three periods, which means most countries with high gini in 1990-2000 were still with high gini in 2000-2010 and 2010-2022, which indicates the general stability of the gini and the difficulty of improving income inequality. However, there are still some countries with high gini in 1990-2000 ending in low and mid gini group in 2010-2022. And there are no countries with low gini in 1990-2010 ending in high gini group in 2010-2022 while there are very few countries with mid gini in 1990-2000 ending in high gini group in 2010-2022. This further shows that countries with less income inequality have performed well in preventing the problem from getting worse.\nOverall, this chart reflects the overall stability of the Gini coefficient and the significant efforts of some countries to reduce income inequality, while also highlighting the success of countries that originally had less income inequality in maintaining stability\n\n\nCode\ndata_GDP &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(country, year) |&gt;        \n  arrange(desc(!is.na(gini)),          \n          desc(popcovr == \"All\"), \n          resource == \"Earnings\") |&gt;\n  slice(1) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\ndata_period &lt;- data_GDP |&gt;\n  mutate(period = case_when(\n    year &gt;= 1990 & year &lt;= 2000 ~ \"1990-2000\",\n    year &gt; 2000 & year &lt;= 2010 ~ \"2000-2010\",\n    year &gt; 2010 & year &lt;= 2022 ~ \"2010-2022\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_\n  )) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(period))\n\ndata_avg_gini &lt;- data_period |&gt;\n  group_by(country, period) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_gini = mean(gini, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    gini_type = case_when(\n      avg_gini &lt; 30 ~ \"Low\",\n      avg_gini &lt;= 40 ~ \"Mid\",\n      TRUE ~ \"High\"\n    )\n  ) \n\n\nalluvial_data &lt;- data_avg_gini |&gt;\n  select(country, period, gini_type) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = period, values_from = gini_type) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    `1990-2000` = replace_na(`1990-2000`, \"Missing\"),\n    `2000-2010` = replace_na(`2000-2010`, \"Missing\"),\n    `2010-2022` = replace_na(`2010-2022`, \"Missing\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(`1990-2000`, `2000-2010`, `2010-2022`) |&gt; \n  summarise(Freq = n())\n\n\nalluvial_data &lt;- alluvial_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    `1990-2000` = factor(`1990-2000`, levels = c(\"High\", \"Mid\", \"Low\", \"Missing\")),\n    `2000-2010` = factor(`2000-2010`, levels = c(\"High\", \"Mid\", \"Low\", \"Missing\")),\n    `2010-2022` = factor(`2010-2022`, levels = c(\"High\", \"Mid\", \"Low\", \"Missing\"))\n  )\n\n\nggplot(alluvial_data, aes(axis1 = `1990-2000`, axis2 = `2000-2010`, axis3 = `2010-2022`, y = Freq)) + \n  geom_flow(aes(fill = `2010-2022`)) +\n  geom_stratum() + \n  geom_text(\n    stat = \"stratum\", \n    aes(label = paste(after_stat(stratum), \"\\n\", after_stat(count))), \n    size = 2\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n    limits = c(\"1990-2000\", \"2000-2010\", \"2010-2022\"), \n    expand = c(0.15, 0.15)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Missing\" = \"#d9d9d9\", \"Low\" = \"#fecc5c\", \"Mid\" = \"#fd8d3c\", \"High\" = \"#e31a1c\"),\n    name = \"Gini Type\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Alluvial Plot of Gini Trends Across Periods\",\n    x = \"Time Period\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )",

    "text": "3.8 How has income inequality (Gini index) been distributed and changing around the world?\nThe Gini coefficient is a widely used metric to measure income inequality within a group of population, ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 represents absolute income inequality and 0 represents absolute income equality. From this interactive graph, we can observe that the Gini coefficient varies significantly across countries worldwide. The areas with lighter color represent high Gini values, indicating severe income inequality. Due to the lack of comprehensive global data, it is challenging to identify clear trends in global Gini. However, we can observe trends for individual countries. For example, in the United States and most European countries, the Gini coefficient has not shown significant changes over the last 50 years. In contrast, for Asian countries such as China and India, the Gini coefficient has exhibited an upward trend over the past 20 years, as reflected in the gradually lighter changing colors.\n\n\nCode\ndata_gini_all_year &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(country, year) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(!is.na(gini)),\n          desc(!is.na(q1)),\n          desc(popcovr == \"All\"),\n          resource == \"Earnings\") %&gt;%\n  slice(1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\ndata_gini_2022 &lt;- data_gini_all_year |&gt; filter(year == 2016)\n\n\n# Data frame with Gini Index\ndata_gini &lt;- data.frame(\n  country = data_gini_2022$country,\n  gini = data_gini_2022$gini,\n  c3 = data_gini_2022$c3,\n  postal = data_gini_2022$c2\n)\n\n\nall_countries &lt;- unique(data_gini_all_year$country)\nall_years &lt;- seq(1950, 2021)\n\n# Step 2: Create a complete grid of country and year\ncomplete_grid &lt;- expand.grid(country = all_countries, year = all_years)\n\n# Populate the grid with Gini coefficient data\ncomplete_grid$gini &lt;- NA\ncomplete_grid$gini &lt;- data_gini_all_year$gini[\n  match(\n    paste(complete_grid$country, complete_grid$year, sep = \"_\"),\n    paste(data_gini_all_year$country, data_gini_all_year$year, sep = \"_\")\n  )\n]\ncomplete_grid$c3 &lt;- data_gini_all_year$c3[match(complete_grid$country, data_gini_all_year$country)]\n\n# Prepare spatial data\nworld &lt;- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\ncomplete_grid$geometry &lt;- world$geometry[match(complete_grid$c3, world$iso_a3_eh)]\n\n# Convert year to a factor for animation\nplot_data &lt;- complete_grid %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.factor(year))\n\n# Define the range for the Gini coefficient\ngini_min &lt;- min(plot_data$gini, na.rm = TRUE)\ngini_max &lt;- max(plot_data$gini, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Create Plotly Choropleth Map\nfig &lt;- plot_ly(\n  data = plot_data,\n  type = \"choropleth\",\n  locations = ~c3,             # Use the ISO3 column for country codes\n  locationmode = \"ISO-3\",      # ISO Alpha-3 codes for mapping\n  z = ~gini,                   # Gini coefficient values\n  frame = ~year,               # Animation frames by year\n  text = ~paste(country, \"&lt;br&gt;Gini Coefficient:\", gini),\n  hoverinfo = \"text\",\n  colorscale = \"Viridis\",       # Use RdYlGn color scale for the map\n  zmin = gini_min,             # Set the minimum for the color scale\n  zmax = gini_max,             # Set the maximum for the color scale\n  colorbar = list(title = \"Gini Coefficient\")\n)\n\n# Customize Layout\nfig &lt;- fig %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"World Gini Coefficients Over Time\",\n    geo = list(\n      projection = list(type = \"natural earth\"),\n      showcoastlines = TRUE\n    )\n  )\n\n# Display the Map\nfig",

The average Gini of each country is calculated using the available Gini index of each year during that period. This plot captures the trends in income inequality across countries over time. Blue dots represent the Gini in period 2000-2022 and red dots represent the Gini in period 1950-2000.

Inequality has risen in some countries, while it has remained relatively stable or even fallen in others, reflecting the impact of global economic developments and policy differences. Most countries have both 1950-2000 and 2000-2022 data. However, some countries face the problem of missing data for the most recent period in 2000-2022, which are displayed at the bottom of the plot.\nSome countries remain high Gini in these two periods including South Africa,Hajti and Brazil in both periods. Among countries with the highest Gini Coefficient, more countries have some degree of increase in Gini while only a few countries improve their inequality and reduce the Gini coefficient like Nambia and Zambia. Further more, Countries with similar Gini Coefficients often have common features in their economic structure, policy choices, or regional influences. For example, Latin American countries generally have high Gini Coefficients, while Western European countries have relatively low Gini\nAt the end when looking at the pattern more broadly, across all countries, there more countries having Gini dramatically decreased or remaining stable compared to those encountering huge increase in Gini. So it reflects most countries did well in controlling the income inequality.",

In particular, top countries in European have almost the same trends of Gini and each Gini line stays really close to each other. This is could resulted in because of the close cooperation and connections between these European countries.\nAfrica and Asia exhibit more volatile patterns compared to the relatively stable trends in Europe and Americas. And Countries in Africa generally have high Gini and Gabon even reached gini of 70 which indicates a severe income inequality.\nGenerally speaking, Developed economics like United States,Canada and Australia demonstrate relatively stable Gini Coefficients while The Gini coefficients in developing regions (such as Africa and Asia) are higher and more volatile, which may reflect differences in economic structure, government policies, and social distribution systems among regions.\n\nThis two scatter plot and smooth line show how income inequality changed over time in the bottom 5 countries with the lowest GDP in each region.

Economic development and inequality\nSome countries which is not developed has encountered a problem of increasing income inequality when they were trying to develop their economic. In Africa, Gini of countries like Malawi and Mozambique all increased after some period. This phenomena is associated with their economic growth and introduction of foreign investment. In Asia, China has done well in reducing income inequality from 1960-1980 but the situations worsened after 1980 which match’s the period when China decided to develop its economic according to some newly published policy. In Europe, Gini of Albania has increased during Albania’s economic transition which means the transition from a planned to a market economy had a negative impact on income equality.",

    "text": "Through our exploratory data analysis of the world income inequality dataset, we found that income inequality is a global problem with long-lasting impact, particularly significant in developing countries such as Brazil and China. In highly developed countries such as the United States and Japan, the structure of income distribution tends to be more stable. The relationship between income distribution and GDP growth rate remains unclear, as no consistent trends were observed across groups of countries. From another perspective, the developing countries have higher GDP growth, while the developed countries are more stable, without any surge in their GDP growth. This can imply that the status of a country’s development is more crucial to reflect its resilience to income inequality. Our analysis has several (limitations), the most significant being the lack of complete data. If we could collect relevant data for every country each year, we would be able to conduct a more comprehensive regional trend analysis. During the analysis, we relied solely on the information provided by the WIID dataset to analyze factors contributing to income inequality. (For future research), we hope to include more detailed economic data, such as demographic changes, inflation rates, stock prices, and other relevant metrics. This would allow for deeper analysis aimed at uncovering more valuable insights and identifying additional factors contributing to income inequality, as well as potential solutions. The most important (lesson we learned) from this project was how to collaborate using GitHub to manage workflows. We believe that starting this project from scratch, reading the data, discussing and deciding on the types of plots to use, and determining the information to include has been an invaluable experience.",
