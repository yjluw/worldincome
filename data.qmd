# Data

## Description
The World Income Inequality Database (WIID) contains comprehensive information about income inequality for 201 countries and historical entities. The current version contains over 24,000 data points with observations from pre-1960s to 2022. The database combines data from various authoritative sources including:

1. LIS Cross-National Data Center (Luxembourg Income Study)
2. Eurostat
3. Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC)
4. United Nations
5. National statistical offices
6. OECD
7. World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)
8. Research studies
9. Other international organizations

The observations are distributed across time periods as follows:

| Time span | Number of observations |
|:----------|---------------------:|
| Total observations | 24,367 |
| Before 1960 | 311 |
| 1960-69 | 714 |
| 1970-79 | 946 |
| 1980-89 | 1,651 |
| 1990-99 | 3,758 |
| 2000-09 | 6,764 |
| 2010-19 | 8,753 |
| 2020- | 1,470 |




## Missing value analysis
To to understand data completeness and potential limitations for our analysis, we should examine the missing values in key variables:

1. Inequality measures (Gini coefficient (`gini`), decile shares (`d1-d10`), quintile shares (`q1-q5`))
2. Resource concepts (income vs. consumption)
3. Geographic coverage
4. Time period coverage
5. Quality ratings of the observations
Sure, here's a formatted version of the analysis in a Quarto document:


## Analyzing Missing Values in the Dataset

To understand the data completeness and potential limitations for our analysis,  we should examine the missing values in key variables:

### Inequality Measures
- Gini coefficient (`gini`)
- Decile shares (`d1-d10`)
- Quintile shares (`q1-q5`)
These are important variables for understanding income and wealth distribution, so we should check for any missing values and the overall coverage.

### Resource Concepts (Income vs. Consumption)
- The variables `resource` and `resource_detailed` indicate whether the data represents income or consumption. 
- We should check for any missing values or imbalance in coverage between income and consumption data.

### Geographic Coverage
- Variables like `country`, `c2`, `c3`, `region_un`, `region_wb` cover different ways of grouping the geographic regions.
- Checking for missing values and understanding the geographic representation in the dataset is important.

### Time Period Coverage
- The `year` variable indicates the survey year, so we should examine the range and completeness of years covered.

### Quality Ratings
- The `quality` and `quality_score` variables provide quality assessments.
- Checking for missing values and understanding the quality distribution is crucial.

### Other Variables
- `population`, `gdp`, `mean`, `median` are also important variables to check for missing data.
- The `source`, `source_detailed`, `source_comments` variables provide information about the data source, which is useful to understand potential limitations.
